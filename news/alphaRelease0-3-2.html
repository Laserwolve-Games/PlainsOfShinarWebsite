			<h1>updates:</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Made the tutorial items a little easier to pick up.</li>
				<li>Improved performance when generating shadows.</li>
				<li>Pressing any key will exit dialog with an NPC.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1>bug fixes:</h1>
			<p>Fixed the following issues:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Moved the player back to the correct starting location. (He'd been moved up by the windmill for
					testing, and we forgot to move him back before releasing 0.3.1, oops.)
				</li>
				<li>The player would still deal damage with melee attacks if the player died in the middle of
					casting them.</li>
				<li>The player sometimes wouldn't finish their attack animation when using the basic attack.</li>
				<li>Shadows weren't appearing for some entities.</li>
				<li>The door to the cottage would sometimes disappear depending on the player's position.</li>
				<li>Enemies with ranged attacks would still sometimes generate their projectile even if they were
					stunned before it appeared.</li>
				<li>Applied all previous bug fixes related to the player's basic attack and abilities, to all
					abilities.</li>
				<li>The player wouldn't rotate to face the NPC they were talking too, if they were already within
					talking range.</li>
			</ul>
